# Amazon-Clone-using-HTML
This is a simple Amazon homepage clone built using pure HTML and CSS. This project replicates the basic structure and design of Amazon's website for learning and practice purposes. Great for beginners exploring web development.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The entire project is built using two main files:
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage using HTML.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styles, colors, layout, and responsiveness using CSS.

### HTML (index.html)
- The `<header>` section includes:
  - Amazon logo (image or text)
  - Search bar
  - Cart icon
- The `<nav>` section contains:
  - Navigation links like "Today's Deals", "Customer Service", etc.
- The `<main>` section includes:
  - Banners (images)
  - Product category cards (e.g., Electronics, Beauty, Clothes)
- The `<footer>` section provides:
  - Links to Amazon policies, help, and contact info.

### CSS (style.css)
- Used `Flexbox` to align items in header and product sections
- Used `Box Model` (margin, padding, borders) for spacing
- Applied `hover` effects on navigation links and buttons
- Used custom fonts and color scheme to match Amazon's theme
- Responsive layout using media queries (if added)
